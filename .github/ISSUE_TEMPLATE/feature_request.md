description: Ideally, a concrete request for a new feature or a change in how
Zulip works. For more open-ended suggestions or feedback, we highly recommend
starting a discussion in the
[#feedback](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/137-feedback) stream in the
[Zulip development community](https://zulip.com/development-community/) instead.
It's the best place to interactively discuss your ideas.
