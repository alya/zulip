# Support the Zulip project

{!supporting-zulip-motivation.md!}

The Zulip community (which includes you!) is a huge part of what makes Zulip
successful. If you appreciate Zulip, there are many ways you can
support the project. Some of these will only take a few minutes of your
time, but still make a big difference.

* [Support Zulip financially](#support-zulip-financially): Sponsoring Zulip
  helps fund free [Zulip Cloud Standard](https://zulip.com/plans/) hosting for
  hundreds of open source projects, research communities, and other worthy
  organizations.

* [Help others find Zulip](#help-others-find-zulip): As a business that's
  [growing sustainably](https://zulip.com/values/) without venture capital
  funding, Zulip cannot afford splashy ad campaigns to compete with giant
  corporations like Salesforce (Slack) and Microsoft (Teams). Zulip depends
  on users and other members of the community to spread the word about the
  difference that using Zulip's organized team chat has made for you or your
  organization.

* [Help improve Zulip](#help-improve-zulip): Zulip is developed by a [vibrant
  open-source community](https://zulip.com/team/), and there are many ways to
  contribute even without writing a single line of code.

## Support Zulip financially

You can sponsor Zulip through the [GitHub sponsors
program](https://github.com/sponsors/zulip) (preferred), on
[Patreon](https://patreon.com/zulip), or on [Open
Collective](https://opencollective.com/zulip). Zulip receives sponsorships from
individuals and organizations.

  [Capterra](https://reviews.capterra.com/new/197945) and

  on review sites when choosing software for their team, and sharing your
