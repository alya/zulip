    Automatic billing is recommended unless you have a specific reason to
    choose manual billing.

With automatic billing, you automatically purchase a Zulip license for each user
in your organization at the start of each billing period (month or year), and
whenever you need additional licenses.

- [Deactivating a user](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user) frees
  up their license for reuse. No refunds are given for unused licenses
  you have purchased.

- If you have no free licenses when you **add a user**, you will be
  automatically billed for an additional license. You will be charged
  a pro-rated rate only for the remaining part of the billing
  period. Each month, you will see a single invoice covering all
  licenses added that month.

For example, suppose you are on a monthly plan that costs $8/user/month, and
that you do the following during the month:

1. Add 1 user half way through the month.
1. Deactivate 5 users the next day.
1. Add 2 users the next day.

At the end of the month you will get a single invoice that combines:

- A $4 charge for adding a license half way through the month.
- A charge for the next month, which will be $16 less than the previous month,
  as you need 2 fewer licenses.




Suppose during that billing month, you:

1. Add 1 user five days before the end of the billing month. This requires
   one additional license, for a total of 16. Additional charges: 
1. Deactivate 4 users the next day, leaving you with 12 users and 16
   licenses.
1. Add 6 more users on the second-to-last day of the billing month,
   bringing you to 18 users, and requiring 2 additional licenses for a
   total of 18.
1. Deactivate 2 users on the last day of the billing month, leaving you
   with 16 users and 18 licenses.

Then, at the end of the billing month, you'll receive a single invoice
for 16 licenses at $3.50/month ($56, aka the initial purchase for the
next month) as well as the previous billing month's pro-rated
purchases of 1 license for 5 days and 2 licenses for 2 days, which
would add up to a total of just over $1.
