When collaborating with people in another time zone, you often need to
express a specific time clearly. Rather than typing out your time zone
and having everyone translate the time in their heads, in Zulip, you
can mention a time, and it'll be displayed to each user in their own
time zone (just like the timestamps on Zulip messages).
