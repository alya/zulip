# How to apply

This page should help you get started with applying for an outreach program
with Zulip.

We try to make the application process as valuable for the applicant as
possible. Expect high-quality code reviews, a supportive community, and
publicly viewable patches you can link to from your resume, regardless of
whether you are selected.

## Application criteria

We expect applicants to have experience with the technologies relevant to their
project, or else have strong general programming experience. If you are just
getting started learning how to program, we recommend taking time to learn the
basics (there are many great online materials available for free!), and applying
in the next program cycle.

There are three key requirements for a successful application:

1. **Demonstrating your ability to contribute to a large codebase.** Accepted
   applicants generally have five or more merged (or nearly merged) pull
   requests, including at least a couple of significant changes (on the order of
   100+ lines). The quality of your best work is more important than the
   quantity, so be sure to [follow our coding
   guidelines](../contributing/code-style.md) and [test your
   work](../contributing/code-reviewing.md#reviewing-your-own-code) before
   submitting it for review.

2. **Clear communication.** Building open-source software is a collaborative
   venture, and effective communication is key to making it successful. Learn
   how to [ask great questions](../contributing/asking-great-questions.md), and
   explain your decisions clearly [in your commit
   messages](../contributing/version-control.md#commit-discipline) and [on your
   pull requests](../contributing/reviewable-prs.md).

3. **Improvement in response to feedback.** Don't worry if you make mistakes in
   your first few contributions! Everyone makes mistakes getting started â€” just
   make sure you don't make the same mistakes next time.

We are especially excited about applicants who:

- Help out other applicants

- Try to solve their own obstacles, and then [ask well-formed
  questions](/contributing/asking-great-questions)

- Develop well thought out project proposals

Starting in 2022, being a student is not required in order to apply to GSoC. We
are happy to accept both student and non-student GSoC participants.

## Getting started

If you are new to Zulip, our [contributor guide](../contributing/contributing.md) is the place
to start. It offers a detailed walkthrough for submitting your first pull
request, with many pointers to additional documentation, and tips on how to get
help if you need it.

We recommend taking the following steps before diving into the issue tracker:

- Join the [Zulip development
  community](https://zulip.com/development-community/), and introduce yourself
  in the stream for the program you are participating in. Before you jump in, be
  sure to review the [Zulip community
  norms](https://zulip.com/development-community/).

- Follow our instructions to [install the development
  environment](../development/overview.md), getting help in [#provision
  help](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/21-provision-help) if needed.

- Familiarize yourself with [using the development
  environment](../development/using.md).

- Go through the [new application feature
  tutorial](../tutorials/new-feature-tutorial.md) to get familiar with how the
  Zulip codebase is organized, and how to find code in it.

As you are getting started on your first pull request:

- Read the [Zulip guide to Git](../git/overview.md). It's especially important
  to master using `git rebase`, so that you can restructure your commits. You can
  get help in [#git help](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/44-git-help) if
  you get stuck.

- To make it easier to structure your PRs well, we recommend installing a
  [graphical Git client](../git/setup.md#get-a-graphical-client).

- Construct [coherent, mergeable
  commits](../contributing/version-control.md#commit-discipline), with clear
  commit messages that follow the [Zulip commit style
  guide](../contributing/version-control.md#commit-messages). More broadly, clear
  communication on your pull request will make your work stand out.

- Carefully follow our [guide to reviewing your own
  code](../contributing/code-reviewing.md) before asking anyone else for a
  review. Catching mistakes yourself will help your PRs be merged faster, and
  folks will appreciate the quality and professionalism of your work.

Our documentation on [what makes a great Zulip
contributor](../contributing/contributing.md#what-makes-a-great-zulip-contributor)
offers some additional advice.

## What to include in your application

In addition to following all the instructions for the program you
are applying to, your application should include the following:

- Details on any experience you have related to the technologies used
  by Zulip, or related to our product approach.
- Links to materials which help us evaluate your level of experience and
  how you work, such as personal projects of yours, including any
  existing open source or open culture contributions you've made and
  any bug reports you've submitted to open source projects.
- Some notes on what you are hoping to get out of your project.
- A description of the project you'd like to do, and why you're
  excited about it.
- Some notes on why you're excited about working on Zulip.
- A link to your initial contribution(s).

## Circulating your proposal for feedback

We highly recommend posting a rough draft of a few sections of your proposal at
least one week before the application deadline. That way, the whole development
community has a chance to give you feedback and help you improve your proposal.

- **What to post:** Please include (1) Links to your contributions
  to Zulip (or other projects), and (2) a paragraph or two explaining
  what you plan to work on.
- **How to post:** We generally prefer Dropbox Paper or Google
  Docs, since those platforms allow people to look at the text without
  having to log in or download a particular app, and you can update the
  draft as you improve your idea.
- **How to ask for feedback:** Please post a link to your draft in the program
  stream (e.g., [#GSoC](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/14-GSoC) or
  [#Outreachy](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/391-Outreachy)) in the
  [Zulip development community](https://zulip.com/development-community/).
