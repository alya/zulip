# Demo organizations

!!! warn ""
    **Note:** The ability to create demo organizations is an upcoming
    feature. It is not available yet.

If you would like to try out Zulip to see if it's right for you,
you can create a demo Zulip organization. Demo organizations differ from a
regular Zulip organization in a few ways:

* You do not need to choose a URL when creating a demo organization.
* A demo organization will be automatically deleted 30 days after creation
unless you convert it to a regular organization before then.
* A demo organization cannot be upgraded to Zulip Standard.


## Creating demo organizations

{start_tabs}

1. Go to zulip.com and click **New organization** in the top-right corner.

1. Enter your email and click **Create organization**. After confirming your
   email, you will be taken to the **Create your organization** page.

1. Check the **Make this a demo organization** checkbox and once you have
   filled out the rest of the form, click **Sign up**.
