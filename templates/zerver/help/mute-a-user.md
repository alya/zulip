# Mute a user

!!! tip ""
    This feature works on an individual basis. In case of a user seriously
    violating the code of conduct of your community, consider requesting
    your organization administrator to [deactivate](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user)
    them instead.


To deal with annoying or troublesome users, you can mute them. Muting someone will
have the following effects:

- The user you muted will not know that they have been muted, and muting will
  not affect their user experience in any way.

- All messages sent by a muted user will automatically be
  [marked as read](/help/marking-messages-as-read) for you, and will never generate
  any desktop, push or email notifications.

- Muted users will be excluded from the right sidebar, the
  [private conversations](/help/private-messages) list, and from the
  [mentions](/help/mention-a-user-or-group) autocomplete for you. Other UI like
  the [reactions list](/help/emoji-reactions#see-who-reacted-to-a-message) will show
  **Muted user** as placeholder text instead of the muted user's actual username.


### Messages sent by muted users

Messages sent by muted users are hidden in your message feed in the following manner:

- Stream messages, and group private messages sent by muted users are hidden under a
  **Click to reveal** banner. The sender's profile picture, sender's name, and the content
  of the message will be hidden until you reveal the message by clicking on it.

- Private messages between you and a user you have muted will not be visible anywhere
  in the UI, unless you specifically [search](/help/search-for-messages) for them.

- The message will not be highlighted even if it mentions you, but it will still
  appear in the mentions tab.
