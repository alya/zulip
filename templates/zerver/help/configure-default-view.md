# Configure default view

The default view in Zulip is the view you reach after logging in
to the Zulip web app.

You can configure which view is set as your default and whether
the keyboard shortcut for the `Esc` key navigation to your
default view is enabled or disabled.

### Change default view

By default, **Recent topics** is the default view;
the previous default, **All messages**, is also supported.

[Contact us](/help/contact-support) if you'd like to be able to
configure a different view as the default.

{settings_tab|display-settings}

2. Under **Advanced**, click on the **Default view** dropdown.

3. Select a view.

4. Open a new Zulip tab or press `Esc`, if enabled, twice (first
   to exit the settings overlay, and again to return to the default
   view) to see your changes in action.

{end_tabs}

### Disable escape navigation to default view

Zulip has a number of [keyboard shortcuts](/help/keyboard-shortcuts)
enabled to enhance the user experience in the app. By default, the
`Esc` key shortcut will ultimately navigate to your default view.

You can disable this keybinding if you would prefer. This will not
disable other `Esc` key shortcuts enabled in the app.

### Disable escape key navigation to default view
